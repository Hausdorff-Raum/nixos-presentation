* Introduction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you
suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself
"Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for
me.

** Key ideas
+ Dependencies are Graphs!
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    nix-store --query --graph $(readlink -f $(which python)) > python.dot
    dot -Tps python.dot -o python.pdf
  #+END_SRC

+ Somehow, we'be been failing to represent then as such, or been doing that implicitly.
+ Nix makes it explicit.

** How build packages from source
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    tar -xf source.tar.gz
    cd source
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.mypath
    make
    make install
  #+END_SRC

** Nix Ecosystem
| Name    | What it does                                                                                 |
|---------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nix     | A lazy, untyped, functional programming language. Built to write declarative configurations. |
| NixOS   | A Linux distribution managed by Nix                                                          |
| Nixpkgs | A place where Nix users place their meta-packages                                            |

* Nix Store
+ ~/nix/store/~ is a Graph
+ ~/nix/store/*~ are the *immutable* nodes of that Graph

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    dirname $(readlink -f $(which nvim))
    /nix/store/40vcicw0v28v6bvl18nqa1ldq9v80m27-neovim-0.7.2/bin
  #+END_SRC

* Nix Expression Language
** Properties
+ Reproducible
+ Composable

** Characteristics
+ DSL
+ Purelly Functional
+ Dynamically Typed
+ Lazy

** Flakes
Flakes are a new feature in the Nix Language
